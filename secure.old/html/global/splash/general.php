<p>The content on this sidebar is customizable. Edit 'splash/general.php' in the HTML folder for your selected theme (theme HTML is located in 'secure/html/<i>&lt;themefolder&gt;</i>'. If that file does not exist, you can find the fallback copy in 'global/splash/general.php'. We don't recommend editing the global theme files. Copy it into your theme and edit it.</p>
